        <p>
            Hello everyone. My name is <abbr title= "Nguyen Ngoc Tuyet Nhi">Nhi</abbr>. 
            July this year is my 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday. I come from Vietnam. I am an Algonquin 
            College student. I am studying Interactive Media Design. 
            In my opinion, this program suits me. In detail, When 
            I was living in Vietnam, I studied Film and Media Production.
            I love doing art-related work.<br/>
            I have a lot of hobbies. I am a fan of fashion. I often go
            shopping with my friends in my free time. My short-term goal 
            is to finish Interactive Media Design with good results. My 
            long-term goal is to find a meaningful job in the future.
            I would like to make people's life more interesting through 
            the knowledge I have learned.<br/>
