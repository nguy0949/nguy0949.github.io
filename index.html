                Hello everyone. My name is <abbr title= "Nguyen Ngoc Tuyet Nhi">Nhi</abbr>. 
                July this year is my 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday. I come from Vietnam. I am an Algonquin 
                College student. I am studying Interactive Media Design. 
                In my opinion, this program suits me. In detail, When 
                I was living in Vietnam, I studied Film and Media Production.
                I love doing art-related work.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a lot of friends. I usually hangout with my friends. 
                I am studying Web Development. This website was created for study purposes.
                My short-term goal is to finish Interactive Media Design with good results. My 
                long-term goal is to find a meaningful job in the future.
                I would like to make people's life more interesting through 
                the knowledge I have learned.
            </p>
